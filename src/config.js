        instructions: [
            'Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolve',
            `After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive
            (Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)
            2 Make and knead the pizza dough: Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.
            Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes. 
            If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand. 
            The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.
            3 Let the dough rise: Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.
            At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.  
            Cover the dough with plastic wrap.`

        instructions: [
            `Add a dash of curry powder. There is one more ingredient that will give your simple egg salad a special zing, and that is a dash of yellow curry powder. Not only will the curry powder give your egg salad sandwich a gentle spicy lift and it will give it a bit more color as well.`,
            `To mayo or not to mayo? You can substitute the mayonnaise in an egg salad sandwich with some ripe avocado; if you do that you’ll need to add some vinegar or lemon juice for an acidic component, and add more salt than you would expect. Personally I prefer my egg salad sandwich with a hefty amount of mayonnaise.
             That said, the amount of mayonnaise is completely a matter of taste`
